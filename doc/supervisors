This document describes the heirarchy of supervisors.

CONNECTIONS
===========

The connection process begins by launching the padxmpp-listener
supervisor (1). This supervisor is charged with establishing and
maintaining all of the padxmpp-tcpserver supervisors (2). Each
tcpserver supervisor handles keeping alive a pool of tcp acceptors (3)
for a specific interface. Once a TCP connection has been accepted the
socket is then handed off to the finite state machine (4) which
finally authenticates the connection and marks it ready to transmit
XML stanzas.
